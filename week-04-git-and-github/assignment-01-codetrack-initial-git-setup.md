# Assignment 1 — CodeTrack: Initial Git Setup (Local Only)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will set up Git correctly on your local machine before starting the CodeTrack project. You will create a local repository and configure your Git identity at both the repository level (local) and the machine level (global). This assignment is local only — you will not push anything to GitHub yet.

---

# Task 1 — Create the CodeTrack Project and Initialize Git

## Goal

Create a `CodeTrack` project folder and initialize it as a Git repository.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git init` inside `CodeTrack` showing "Initialized empty Git repository"

### Notes

**1. What is the `.git` folder, and why does it matter?**
The .git folder is where Git stores everything it needs to track my project  things like the full commit history, branches, and configuration. It's hidden by default because it's not part of my actual code; it's Git's internal bookkeeping. If I deleted it, my files would still be there but Git would have no memory of any changes I ever made — it would be like the project was never versioned at all.

---

# Task 2 — Configure Git Identity Locally (Repository-Only)

## Goal

Set your Git username and email for the `CodeTrack` repository only, using `git config --local`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config --local --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`

# Task 3 — Configure Git Identity Globally

## Goal

Set a global Git username and email for this machine using `git config --global`. Note that CodeTrack's local settings still take priority over these.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Output of `git config --global --list` showing your `user.name` and `user.email`
